# Run the Program
1. In terminal, type make or make prog3
2. Type ./prog3 -m <m_val> -c <c_val> -d <d_val> -1 <path_to_input1> -2 <path_to_intput2> to run the program
3. -m, -c, and -d are optional; if they are not specified, the default value will be used. -1 and -2 are required.
4. After running the program, it produces a file called out.txt that has the matching score on the first line, modified DNA 1 on the second line, and modified DNA 2 on the third line.
